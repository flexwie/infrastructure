# Kubernetes Cluster Infrastructure

This repository holds the cluster instastructure as code for my K8s clusters on Azure (with AKS) and the Oracle Cloud (self managed).
It is a work in progress, tough I don't actively work on the Oracle cluster anymore, because the availibility of ARM instances in Germany is too flaky at the moment.
